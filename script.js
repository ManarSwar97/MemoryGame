//Pseudocode
//HTML
//create two html pages
//the first page contains: title of the game - instruction - a start button that'll navigate to the game page 
//(Maybe I'll add an option for the user to choose the number of cards he want)
//the second page contains: a timer - a score that'll calculate how many times the player wins - cards 



//CSS
//we need to use grid to align the cards in the page
//style the pages
//add flipping animation for the cards when they flipped 



//Javascript
//add an array to save the card locations
//when the game start the timer will start and the cards should be flipped and randomized
//the user should be able to find all matches cards to win
//if the user select two unmatched cards they'll be flipped again
//if the user select two matched cards they'll display
//if the user didn't find all the matching cards within the time required it'll show a message that he lose
//if the user find all the matching cards within the time required it'll show a message that he win
//if the user win it'll increase the store and show an option if he want to continue playing the game

//optionals
//add a sound effect when the user win or lose
//add music
